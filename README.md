# DK Ktor Starterpack for real-world API development for Kotlin

Production ready , and easy to use starterpack for Ktor API development. It has Sensible feature set which every large-scale (or quality)  application should have.

The source code can also serve as learning material. It's build with personal know-how and experience collected during development in `PHP + Laravel`, `Typescript + express`, `C# + Unity3D`, `Swift iOs Apps`. and more..

It is designed with large-scale applications in mind.

I hope it helps you! Feel free leave feedback or your ideas (Code review appreciated).

## Main focus:
- Modern (y2023) - Kotlin & Ktor based, using kotlin advanced features
- Best practices - Domain Driven Design, Clean Architecture, SOLID, KISS, YAGNI, DRY
- Simplicity - Clarity, Obviousness, No-Magic, No-annotations, NO-unnecessary features,
- Easy-to-use - (preconfigured, extendable, DI, config (support .env), logging, example REST included)
- Modular Approach -
    - every module is self-contained (single folder) and can be used independently
    - Loose coupling
    - wn Routing, Dependency Injection, Services etc..
- Production Ready
    - it is suited for small and large projects
    - Performance (Ktor, Kotlin, Coroutines, EventLoop)
    - Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, CI/CD, Monitoring, Logging, Metrics, etc..

## Technology stack:
- Kotlin
- Ktor (framework)
- Koin (DI library)
- Logback (Logging configured for ELK (Kibana, Logstash))
- dotenv `.env`
- Swagger UI (exposed API Documentation )
- JUnit5
- Docker
- Gradle
- Prometheus
- REST API
